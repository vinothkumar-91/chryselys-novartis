From our perspective,

We've made significant progress in meeting the current project requirements. However, we are striving for a 100% output.

Challenges we're encountering include:

Our project heavily relies on .NET, and Bhavan is the sole .NET developer, although he is not at a senior level.
In terms of our .NET experience, we are not on par with the MOJO Team.
While the project's architectural plan is sound, there are issues with the code and file structure.
The project lacks adherence to a file/module/component structure, making it challenging to handle change requests (CRs).
Given the current timeline, dedicating three days to unit testing is insufficient.
We need to establish a stable testing environment that does not trigger errors in our dependent modules.
Our team's PCs are not adequately equipped for the demands of this project, necessitating an upgrade.
To address these challenges, we believe it is essential for both myself and my team to receive advanced .NET training. Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of the project's code and structure is crucial, as it will significantly benefit our handling of future CRs.



Hi Mani,

From my perspective,

We almost completed the given requirement currently. We trying to get 100% output.

Challage Facing:
	- Our project heavily relies on .NET, and Bhavan is the sole .NET developer, although he is not at a senior level.
	- In terms of our .NET experience, we are not on par with the MOJO Team.
	- Their project/architect plan is good but in code structure is not fine to understand/handle.
	- They are not followed the file/module/component structure. So it is very defecult to handle the CR's.
	- Given the current timeline, dedicating four days to unit testing is insufficient. 
	- Need to setup for testing(without error in our dependent module) before we take unit testing.
	- Our team's PCs are not support for this project. so, we need to upgrade all of our team PC's.
	
To address these challenges, we believe it is essential for both myself and my team to receive advanced .NET training. Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of the project's code and structure is crucial, as it will significantly benefit our handling of future CRs.
